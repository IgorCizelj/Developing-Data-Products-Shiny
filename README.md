Developing-Data-Products-Project
================================

This is the repository where the Developing Data Products Project assignment is located. The shiny application that has been developed is "Populations of US Cities Through History".
It is very simple to use, just use the slider to decide on the Year (from 1800 to 2010, in increments of 10) and the dropdown menu to decide on the State (CA, TX, NY, FL, IL, PA, OH, GA, MI, or NC). On the map, citis that belong to the selected States will show up and they will be colorcoded depending on the population of the selected Year.
The data set used can be found here: https://github.com/cestastanford/historical-us-city-populations
The files of the applications are:
* ui.R
* server.R

The application can be accessed: https://igorcizelj.shinyapps.io/HistUSCitiesPopulation/
